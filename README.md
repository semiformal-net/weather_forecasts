# Weather

Some scripts to collect weather prediction xml from Environment Canda and parse it. I may use this some day for some DS project.

## Updates

Forecasts are updated hourly automatically with a github action. This used to just pull forecasts for Toronto and those old forecasts are in `old_forecasts.tar.gz`. Now all cities are pulled and put in a folder corresponding to their province.
